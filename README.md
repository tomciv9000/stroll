## STROLL
Stroll is a virtual memory lane experience. The application allows you to record areas that have been important or memorable in your life as well as the individual locations and memories that are assocaited with them.  By integrating with the Google Maps API, not only are your locations plotted on a map, but you are invited to explore your old haunts using the integrated Google Streetview.

This Single-Page Application is built using React-Redux with a Rails API back-end and PostgreSQL database.
